This project analyzes the X-Wines global dataset, which contains nearly 100,000 wines and over 21 million consumer ratings, to identify the key attributes that drive consumer preferences and provide actionable insights for wineries, retailers, and importers. After extensive data cleaning, we explored how factors such as alcohol content (ABV), acidity, elaboration style, wine type, and geographic origin relate to consumer ratings. Our analysis shows that wines with moderate-to-high ABV, medium-to-high acidity, and classic blend styles consistently score higher, while Red and Dessert wines outperform other categories. Strong regional patterns also emerge, with wines from areas such as Napa Valley, Pauillac, and Lebanon receiving notably higher ratings. These findings suggest clear opportunities for business stakeholders: prioritize inventory toward high-performing styles and regions, emphasize medium-acidity and moderate-ABV wines in marketing and recommendations, and use regional and stylistic performance benchmarks to guide assortment planning and promotional strategy.
